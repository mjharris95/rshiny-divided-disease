# Divided Disease RShiny

Code used to generate an [interactive app](https://mallory-harris.shinyapps.io/divided-disease/) based on an awareness-based behavior disease model with social division, accompanying the [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.20.22275407) "Social divisions and risk perception can drive divergent epidemic dynamics and large second and third waves."

The main RShiny app, including code used to generate interactive components is contained in the script app.R. Rmarkdown files explaining each model in order of increasing complexity are: basic.rmd, protective.rmd, awareness.rmd, and groups.rmd. Additionally, an overview of the website's features and biographies of the creators are contained in RMarkdown files and overview.rmd and Credits.rmd respectively.
